        Welcome to Rhyme! This is a note-taking app that helps you with rhyming
        and visualizing rhyme schemes. It has all the functions of a normal
        note-taking app (add doc, delete doc, rename doc), but with the added
        bonus of having a rhyme dictionary attached. This dictionary helps you
        find rhymes (such as rhyming with your most recent word) and also
        visualizing it via a color coded rhyme scheme. Additionally, it has a
        page dedicated to the rhyme dictionary, allowing you to add words and
        search for them. You have to log in to start taking notes/rhyming and
        you can also register for an account.

        Listening to music is one of my hobbies, but especially listening to hip
        hop/rap. Rhyme can be incredibly important for a rap song. I got the
        idea for this from YouTube videos where people will spend hours color
        coding a verse or two from a famous artist.

        I wasn't sure exactly where to start, so I began by seeing if anyone
        else had set out to do the same thing. It turns out Wall Street Journal
        already had done this out of their passion for the musical, Hamilton.
        They described their algorithm in enough detail that I could create my
        own similar to theirs.
        <a href="https://graphics.wsj.com/hamilton/">Here's</a> their algorithm
        visualized, and

        their algorithm explained.

        This is very much a work in progress. It is not polished, yet, and I
        have other ideas for it (I hope to use data mining, ML, and DL to expand
        upon this idea once I take those classes).
