##### todo:

- create hidden admin account (not seeded)
- last opened field on documents
- fix light theme
- make dictionary info secure (not changeable by non-admin users)
- api endpoint for profile information
- polish up color coded window
- edit query params in /documentView to take a document, not an id, since /index already has the full document now with the refactor
